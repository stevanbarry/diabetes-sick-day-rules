App for diabetics to help them manage periods of sickness

The App will give a simple guide to diabetics who need reminders about what to do should they get unwell. The content of the app has been taken from the NHS approved guide - http://www.trend-uk.org/documents/TREND%20consensus.pdf

The site is built using <a href="http://framework7.io/">http://framework7.io/</a> as the protoyping tool.

The backend will probably use Node.
